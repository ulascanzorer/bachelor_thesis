Dear Nikita, I hope you are doing fine!

This week, regardless of how hard I tried, I couldn't get many solid results, so I thought maybe I could inform you by text and we could skip the meeting.

I wrote the code to extract the works from ORCID, but then realised, that in order to get the information of the author order (first author, co-author,...) for a particular work, I must have the current author's name, since contributors are given by name and not by ORCID (at least most of the time).

Because of this I write a script to extract the biggest summary file.
I tried to run it through the server in a docker container, but sadly everything takes very long, even if I use the time to write code to get another part of the database while waiting. Also, I think sometimes the server is overloaded somehow and my script in the docker container runs super slow. For example my script (multiprocessed), which was quite fast two days ago runs like a snail today, I will try to run it in the night as well.

Just to clarify, I try to get the following information for the authors from ORCID:

ORCID, given names, family name, put codes (unique values in ORCID) of works and which author they were in these works (perhaps also fields which give the number of works they have as authors, co-authors etc.).

And for the releases (works):

put code, title, publication year, external url (a url to access the work, if exists)

Thanks in advance!
