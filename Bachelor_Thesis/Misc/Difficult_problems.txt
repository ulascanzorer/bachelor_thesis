1) The APIs available mostly did not have tags about the releases, therefore we could only search for releases with specific titles. In order to get a good result, we had to generate words related to our input that could be in a title, which was a relatively difficult task.

2) There are many people from different fields who share the same name. We thought of discriminating them based on their ORCIDs, but not all of these people have ORCIDs and usually in the release data we get back from the API, these ids aren't included. Therefore, we decided to merge all the people with the same names (excluding the ones in the same response page) and if this is the case mark them with "'multiple_authors: True'". If they are marked as such, we return some ORCIDs that may possibly belong to these different people. We could in theory decide who has which ORCID by looking at their page on ORCID and their releases there, but not all people's releases are on ORCID, therefore we only include the ORCIDs depending on their relevance to our input (which is again a difficult task).
