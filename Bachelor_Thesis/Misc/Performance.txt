Performance testing:

for all of the cases: title = ["optimisation"], fatcat api

1) Multithreaded, add releases with insert_one():
    26 minutes

2) Multithreaded, add releases with insert_many():
    25 minutes

3) Multithreaded, add releases with insert_many(), add the authors with insert_many(), then aggregate them in the end.
    39 SECONDS (and also 1 minute 10 seconds, so singlethreaded looks like the way to go)

4) Singlethreaded, add releases with insert_many(), add the authors with insert_many(), then aggregate them in the end.
    1 minute 7 seconds (also 58 seconds)
