5. week:

1) I feel like I have a lot of problems that don't seem to have good solutions. I am afraid that maybe I am not good enough to find these solutions, even though I work really hard for this.

2) I don't know how I will be judged (in terms of the final grade) because of these problems. I feel like there are so many problems that when combined I won't be able to come up with a well functioning project in terms of its goals. I know all the reasons for these problems and ways to "solve" them or why they can't be solved, but I feel like this is not enough, although I feel like it should be.

3) Why do I have to use celery with django, I have read that django by itself can handle multiple requests.

4) Does django also include the server or... I am a little confused with that.

5) ORCID data is too big, but using the API is also too slow...

########################################################################################

6. week:

1) Comparing ORCID names is difficult, because the names in the releases are abbreviated and the formats are different altogether.

2) In the worst case scenario we make 10_000 * 10 = 100_000 chatgpt API calls in order to determine if the releases are relevant to the topic or not, we have to fix this somehow.

3) Which filters shall we use (Right now I have gender and date)?
gender, date (year), minimum number of publications in total, minimum number of first authorships, minimum number of last authorships)

########################################################################################

7. week:

1) I MUST get the names of the orcids, in order to determine their "author order" in the works. Even that won't work 100% correctly, because the names in the contributors of a work can sometimes be abbreaviated, so I will have to see if individiual name parts match with the contributor name, so if two people with the same surname contribute to a work, it won't be possible to determine their "author orders". In order to get the names first, I must first download the summaries file to the server, since according to my calculations it doesn't fit in my computer.

2) Am I doing multiprocessing wrong?

########################################################################################

8. week:

1) I think we should check for the "validity" of all of the works at the very end. Because even in the first step, I create a subconcepts list which are comprised of individual words, so for example with there would be "deep" and "learning" there, so we would get a lot of unrelated stuff with "learning". If we use them without splitting them we might miss variations of subconcepts in the titles. For example if we save "attention mechanisms" as a subconcept, a title with "attention based mechanisms" in it would be skipped.

2) How many pages for the paper, how many figures, overleaf?

3) Should I add number of works as a field as well, so that we can filter using that as well => yes.

########################################################################################

9. week:

1) Some help with regex (trying to check if a title contains a string, i.e (something | something_else | something_else etc.))?

2) What kind of result page would be nice? (download button, counts as graphs (x axis authors, y axis author roles), button to go to authors' orcid page)

3) Django, wouldn't the context that I give to the template be too big if I use the complete result.

########################################################################################

10. week:

1) How formal should the paper be?
